To setup your development environment you can install the latest version directly from the most up-to-date version 
of the source code by cloning/forking the GitHub repository

```bash

Once you have the source, you can build G2Aero in development mode by executing

```bash
python setup.py develop
```
or

```bash
pip install -e .
```

in the top-level directory. The required Python packages will automatically be
installed as well.

To test that the package is working correctly, run

```bash

```

This will run a basic test problem.
